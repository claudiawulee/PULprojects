      <h1>Samoyed</h1>

      <p>The Samoyed is a substantial but graceful dog standing anywhere from 19 to a bit over 23 inches at the shoulder. Powerful, tireless, with a thick all-white coat impervious to cold, Sammies are perfectly beautiful but highly functional. Even their most delightful feature, a perpetual smile, has a practical function: The upturned corners of the mouth keep Sammies from drooling, preventing icicles from forming on the face.   A Sammy sentenced to solitary confinement in the yard is a miserable and destructive creature. These are smart, social, mischievous dogs who demand love and attention. Sammies need structure in training. Teach them what's expected of them early, and practice it with them often.

        Samoyeds, the smiling sled dogs, were bred for hard work in the world's coldest locales. In the Siberian town of Oymyakon, for instance, temperatures of minus-60 degrees are common. The Sammy's famous white coat is thick enough to protect against such brutal conditions. Powerful, agile, tireless, impervious to cold, Sammies are drop-dead gorgeous but highly functional. Even their most delightful feature, a perpetual smile, has a practical function: The mouth's upturned corners keep Sammies from drooling, preventing icicles from forming on the face.</p>

        <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Samoyed is truly an ancient breed, selected by nomadic tribes in Siberia to herd their reindeer and double as sled pullers when needed</li>
        <li>Samoyeds then joined many polar expeditions, notably "Etah" who led Roald Amundsen's first trip to the South Pole.</li>
        <li>Many Samoyeds still work today, herding reindeer and pulling sleds as well as being family companions in much of the world.</li>

      <br><caption>Brown Shiba Inu sitting on chair staring at the camera</caption>
      <p>An ancient Japanese breed, the Shiba Inu is a little but well-muscled dog once employed as a hunter. Today, the spirited, good-natured Shiba is the most popular companion dog in Japan. The adaptable Shiba is at home in town or country. Brought to America from Japan as recently as 60 years ago, Shibas are growing in popularity in the West and are already the most popular breed in their homeland. Their white markings combined with their coloring (red, red sesame, or black and tan) and their alert expression and smooth stride makes them almost foxlike. They're sturdy, muscular dogs with a bold, confident personality to match.</p>

      <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Shiba Inus were bred to hunt and flush small game, such as rabbits and birds. Their small, fox-like stature enabled them to excel at chasing after small games. </li>
        <li>Shiba Inus shed heavily twice a year. The heavy shedding typically lasts for three weeks.</li>
        <li>The average life expectancy of a Shiba Inu is 12 to 15 years.</li>
